            <h1>Hello world (We are in the ENDGAME now)</h1>
            <p>Everybody wants a happy ending, right? But it doesn't always roll that way. Maybe this time. I'm hoping
                if you play this back... it's in celebration. I hope families are reunited. I hope we get it back, in
                somewhat like a normal version of the planet has been restored, if there ever was such a thing.God, what
                a world. Universe now. If you told me 10 years ago that we weren't alone, let alone you know to this
                extent... I mean, I wouldn't have been surprised. But come on, you know. That epic forces of darkness
                and light that have come into play. And for better or worse, that's the reality Morgan's going to find a
                way to grow up in.</p>

        <div class="box-2">
            <h1>Goodbye, World!</h1>
            <p>So I found a private area to record a little greeting in case of an untimely death on my part. Not that
                death at any time is ever timely.

                This time travel thing that we are going to pull off tomorrow... it's got me scratching my head about
                the survivability of all this. But then again that's the hero gig. Part of the journey is the end. What
                am I tripping for? Everything is going to work out exactly the way it's supposed to.

                I love you 3000

            <p>Interesting theory, but I don't think so. The Soul Stone is aware of and sees into the soul of every of
                the quadrillion, quintrillion, sextillion or whatever sentient beings in the entire universe. That's a
                lot of souls. It knows who you are and who you came from.
